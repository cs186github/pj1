 Part I: Tuple related.
 1. TupleDesc: At first, we use a list to maintain the contents of a tuple description.
 We choose this for three reasons: 1> list is very simple. 2> we have no idea
 how to get a high performance container to hold the position. 3> we use it 
 temprarily, when we find a well satisfied one, we will replace it. Secondly, we assume
 the two TupleDesc is the same if they have the same Item, no matter what order they are
 placed in the container. We also assume two Item is the same if and only if
 two Items are exactly have the same field name and the same field type. Thirdly,
 for performance reason, there is a possiblity that the merge method need to be 
 improved later. Fourthly, we use a "null" name to spacify an empty fieldName. It really
 simplifies the code.
